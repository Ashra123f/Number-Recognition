# Number-Recognition
Number recognition using the MNIST dataset is a classic machine learning task that involves training a model to recognize handwritten digits. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) along with their corresponding labels.The MNIST dataset is a great starting point for learning about image classification and machine learning in general.While it's a relatively simple dataset by today's standards, it still provides valuable insights into how various algorithms and neural network architectures work.
